# List Pagination and Filtering

This project enhances the usability of a web page with pagination. This project uses "progressive enhancement" so that JavaScript is used to enhance the web page, without making the web page dependent upon JavaScript. The pagination is dynamic, meaning it will work for any list containing any number of items. This project was created for the purpose of the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree.

## Project Requirements

This project is reviewed and graded based on a set of requirements.

### Meets Expectations

* No inline JavaScript. All JS is linked from an external file.
* Uses unobtrusive JavaScript to append markup for the pagination links. So none of the pagination link's markup is added into the HTML.
* Pagination links are created. If there are 44 students, 5 links should be generated, if there’s 66 students, 7 links should be generated.
* The first 10 students are shown when the page loads, and each pagination link displays the correct students.
* Clicking on “1” in the pagination links should show students 1 to 10. Clicking “2” shows 11 to 20. Clicking “5” shows students 41 to 50, and so on.
* Code comments have been added explaining how the functions work.

### Exceeds Expectations

* Use unobtrusive JavaScript to append HTML for a search bar.
* Pagination links display based on how many search results are returned. For example: if 10 or fewer results are returned, 0 or 1 pagination links are displayed. If 22 search results are returned, 3 pagination links are displayed.
* When a search yields 0 results, a message is displayed on the page, informing the user that no results have been found.
